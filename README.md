## Introduction

This is a reanalysis of the predictive model from the "Virtual screening for high affinity guests for synthetic supramolecular receptors", https://doi.org/10.1039/C5SC00534E. The original model was a multivariate linear regression run in microsoft excel. I am going to move this to python for use in teaching. Initialy I will keep the experiemnt as close to the original literature as possible, then repeat it with a current data science approach including some EDA and using sklearn to split the data in to training and test sets. This is for use in my teaching on a university teaching module "applications of data science" at Hallam university, the session is run over a 1 hr online session with an introduction to the literature, like we are still stuck in the pandemic but colab is great for this.

## Code development
This repoduces the analysis in the manuscript and then reanalysis the data using a current data science approach. The code is writen in R and run localy in a RStudio .md file.. It uses Availible R librires to facilitate the complettion of the task in a one hour session.

## Usage instructions
Currently we run our analysis in the xxx.xx

## File structure of the project
There ia an **.csv* files copied from the suplimentory information in the manscript. There is also two **.xx* one of which we will run RStudio in our session.
