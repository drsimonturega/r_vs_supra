## Introduction

This is a reanalysis of the predictive model from the "Virtual screening for high affinity guests for synthetic supramolecular receptors", https://doi.org/10.1039/C5SC00534E. The original model was a multivariate linear regression run in microsoft excel. I am going to move this to R for use in teaching. Initialy I will keep the experiemnt as close to the original literature as possible, then repeat it with a current data science approach including some EDA and R to split the data in to training and test sets. This is for use in my teaching on a university teaching module "data science" at Hallam university, the session is run over two 2 hr IT sessions.

## Code development
This repoduces the analysis in the manuscript and then reanalysis the data using a current data science approach. The code is writen in R and run localy in a RStudio .md file.. It uses Availible R librires to facilitate the complettion of the task in a one hour session.

## Usage instructions
Currently we run our analysis in the *r_sup_001.Rmd*

## File structure of the project
There are two **.csv* files copied from the suplimentory information in the manscript. The data was cleaned in python because I had already completted it, python is probably better suited to the task and didn't want waste time repeating it.
